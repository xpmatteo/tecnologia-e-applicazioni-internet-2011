Picture Gallery!

Object of the exercise is to familiarize ourselves with writing simple web apps in Java.

You will find a set of pictures in the folder ../pictures-at-an-exhibition.

- First stage: import the project in Eclipse and run it.  Open the browser at http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the application.  You might have to correct a pathname to see the picture though.

- Second stage: change the application so that it displays an HTML unordered list (i.e. with bullet points) of the filenames of all pictures in the ../pictures-at-an-exhibition folder.  At this stage you may leave the pathname hardcoded in the Java code.  You should see

  * boccioni.lastrada.jpg
  * g.de_chirico_la_torre_rossa.jpg
  * joie.jpg
  * le-nord-sud.jpg
  
- Third stage: change the application so that when I visit http://localhost:8080/joie.jpg I see the corresponding picture (no HTML, just the picture)

- Fourth stage: change the application so that it shows the actual pictures under the names of the files.  

- Fifth stage: change the application so that it reads the .properties files and shows the titles and captions for each picture.

- Sixth stage: the name of the directory that holds the picture must not appear in the source code!  You have three options:
  - Pass it as an argument on the command line
  - Pass it as a system property, e.g., -Dpicture.gallery.pathname=/home/foo/bar
  - Write it in a "properties" file that is loaded by the application at startup.
  In all cases the application should refuse to start if the pathname is not given or not found, or points to an unreadable directory, and produce a *clear* error message.  

- Seventh stage: (optional) change the app so that it shows a thumbnail for each picture.  When I click the thumbnail, it should show the full-size picture.
